### Dependencies

Initially we load all the project dependencies, the following code will do that for us and in case they aren't installed it'll installed all the required packages.

```{r}
pacotes <- c(
  "arules",
  "tidyverse",
  "arulesViz",
  "skimr",
  "readr",
  "here",
  "readr",
  "here"
)

for(pckgs in pacotes){
  if(!require(pckgs,character.only = TRUE)) install.packages(pckgs)
  library(pckgs,character.only = TRUE)
}

```

### Data pre-processing

In this step the data with the closing price for the stocks and their corresponding names are loaded.

```{r}
closePriceFile_path <- here(paste0("data","2020closePrice SAX-240_60_10.csv"))
dat <- read.csv(closePriceFile_path) %>%
  select(-c(X, X45))
dat.cols <- read.table(
  dat,
  header = FALSE,
  sep = "\t",
  fileEncoding = "latin1"
)

```

The dataframe columns are renamed with the names loaded in the variable "dat.cols". We substitute the values with the closing price below and above average.

-   0 - Stocks with closing price **below** average

-   1 - Stocks with closing price **above** average
